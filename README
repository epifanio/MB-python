This is an ALPHA version of MB utilities in python.  These utilities
are written in Python to interact with multibeam bathymetry data and
metadata used with 
MB-System <http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/pi/MB-System> by David
W. Caress and Dale N. Chayes.  Use of this program is only recommended
at the present time for those very familiar with both MB-System
and PostGIS.  Please see security WARNING below!

Currently, only the program mbnav2sql.py is in a functional state.
This program is intended to add files from an MB datalist (which may
be recursive, containing other datalists) to a PostGIS database in
order to complement the capabilities of MB-System programs such as
mbdatalist.  This allows the powerful spatial queries in PostGIS to
apply to multibeam navigation.  For example, one might query to get a
list of files within 50 km of the coast of the island of Oahu.  It
also allows browsing of navigation files with a GIS program that can
interact with a PostGIS database.  I have tested with Qgis, which
works well (but can be slow for many large navigation files).

There is currently limited functionality, but testing has included
added over 26,000 files to a PostGIS database.  Please let me know if
you find this program useful, if you find bugs or have suggestions.

Use "mbnav2sql.py -h" for help and command line options.

EXAMPLES:

Add files to an existing database (see
<http://blog.quaternio.net/2009/03/10/postgis-beginner-notes> or the
PostGIS documentation for how to set up a new database named "gis_test"):

% mbnav2sql.py -I datalist.mb-1 -v
% psql -d gis_test
gis_test=# SELECT COUNT (*) FROM multibeam.datafiles
 count 
-------
    40
(1 row)

To show the number of files with more than 10,000 navigation points:
gis_test=# SELECT COUNT (*) FROM multibeam.datafiles WHERE ST_NPoints(the_geom) > 10000;

And to simplify those navigation points for faster computation and display
(CAUTION: replaces full resolution navigation!):
gis_test=# UPDATE multibeam.datafiles SET the_geom = ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology(the_geom,0.0001) WHERE ST_NPoints(the_geom) > 1000;


WARNING:

Although some checking is done on input, PostgreSQL communication is
currently not done in an entirely secure manner.  DO NOT USE with a
production database or with any important data unless you are SURE
exactly what you are doing.  For more information on the potential
dangers of SQL injection attacks, please see <http://xkcd.com/327>.

TODO: 

- improve security of SQL cursor commands
- Use PostGIS GEOGRAPHY datatype which recognizes spherical geometry
  instead of flat GEOMETRY datatype (essentially a plate carr√©e
  projection).
- Add timestamps for start and end times of each file to database
- Link cruiseid to metadata for each cruise, ideally with automatic retrieval of
  metadata from archives such as
  http://www.marine-geo.org/tools/web_services.php
  or
  http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/metadata/published/NGDC_-_MGG_-_Multibeam_Survey/list
- and plenty more....
