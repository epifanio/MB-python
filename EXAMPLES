TO add files to an existing database (see
<http://blog.quaternio.net/2009/03/10/postgis-beginner-notes> or the
PostGIS documentation for how to set up a new database named "gis_test"):

% mbnav2sql.py -I datalist.mb-1 -v
% psql -d gis_test
gis_test=# SELECT COUNT (*) FROM multibeam.datafiles
 count 
-------
    40
(1 row)

To show the number of files with more than 10,000 navigation points:
gis_test=# SELECT COUNT (*) FROM multibeam.datafiles WHERE ST_NPoints(the_geom) > 10000;

And to simplify those navigation points for faster computation and display
(CAUTION: replaces full resolution navigation!):
gis_test=# UPDATE multibeam.datafiles SET the_geom = ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology(the_geom,0.0001) WHERE ST_NPoints(the_geom) > 1000;

To list metadata for all files in database and list them in
chronological order with the number of navigation points in each field
and the number of data records in the original file, try:

gis_test=# SELECT cruise_id, filename, ST_NPoints(track::geometry) AS geog, ST_NPoints(the_geom) AS geom, records, start_time, end_time FROM multibeam.datafiles ORDER BY start_time;

For a list of all the cruise_id values in the database, use:

gis_test=# SELECT DISTINCT cruise_id FROM multibeam.datafiles;
